# Build and run

## Requirements

The normal kernel build targets 32-bit x86 and uses GCC-compatible compiler
support for `-m32`, GNU binutils, and NASM. Building an ISO and running it also
requires gzip, GRUB tooling, ISO creation utilities, and QEMU. Package names
differ by distribution; on Debian/Ubuntu, the common packages include
`build-essential`, `gzip`, `nasm`, `qemu-system-x86`, `grub-pc-bin`, `xorriso`,
and `mtools`.

## Build the kernel

From the repository root:

```sh
make -j"$(nproc)"
```

The default output is `build/kernel.bin`, an uncompressed Multiboot loader with
the gzip-compressed kernel ELF embedded in it. The standalone compressed ELF
is `build/openkernel.elf.gz`. `make linux` additionally builds
`build/openkernel`, a small Linux launcher that starts QEMU; it is not a
hosted implementation of OpenKernel's kernel or shell.

## Create and boot the ISO

```sh
make os.iso
```

`make os.iso` builds the kernel and separate loadable modules, stages a
minimal initramfs from the tracked `initramfs/` template, copies in the GRUB
configuration, and creates `os.iso`. No ignored or pre-existing `initfs/`
directory is required. The default init is a text script that reports that no
userspace shell is included in the repository. `make run-linux` additionally
builds the QEMU launcher and boots the generated ISO.

The GRUB source configuration is `boot/grub.cfg`; generated ISO files are
placed under `iso/`. `build_fs.sh <kernel-version>` can regenerate the
initramfs after `make modules`.

Pass QEMU arguments through Make, for example:

```sh
make run-linux QEMU_ARGS="-m 256"
```

The launcher can be selected with `OPENKERNEL_QEMU`; its ISO path can be set
with `OPENKERNEL_ISO`. `run.sh` is a separate convenience script and currently
invokes QEMU directly with its own audio options.

## Hosted launcher versus kernel

`host/main.c` only calls `execvp()` to start QEMU with the ISO. It does not
emulate system calls, provide a Linux-hosted VFS, or run the shell natively.
See [Architecture and current status](../kernel/overview.md) for the security
and process-model limitations of the kernel itself.
