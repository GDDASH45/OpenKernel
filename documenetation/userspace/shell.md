# Userspace init and shell

The tracked initramfs includes a small text init script, but this repository
does not include a userspace shell binary. The default script reports this
limitation after the kernel boots. Device nodes are provided by the kernel's
devtmpfs, not init.

The following describes the shell interface supported by the prebuilt shell
image used by earlier builds; it is not included in the ISO built from this
repository.

## Shell built-ins

The shell provides:

`help`, `about`, `ls [path]`, `cd [path]`, `pwd`, `clear`, `version`, `uname`,
`whoami`, `pid`, `echo TEXT`, `true`, `false`, `status`, and `exit`.

`ls` and `cd` use the VFS directory-list syscall. The shell maintains its own
current-directory string, initially `/`; external bare names are resolved
relative to that path. This is not a process-wide kernel working directory and
there is no PATH search.

Commands not recognized as built-ins are sent to `execve()`. A successful
execution replaces the current flow until the program returns; the shell then
continues. `argv` reaches the current wrapper but the kernel loader ignores it.

## Input and parsing limits

Input is dispatched one keyboard character at a time using the userspace
`ok_input_dispatch()` helper. The parser splits on spaces only: quotes,
escapes, pipes, redirection, environment variables, and command chaining are
not implemented. Command and path buffers are fixed-size. Shell external
program execution accepts a limited number of whitespace-separated arguments.

`exit` intentionally refuses to exit PID 1. Keyboard input is translated by
the PS/2 driver; see [Display and input](../kernel/display-input.md). Directory
listing depends on the VFS tree and does not expose the separate persistent
OKFS2 store; see [VFS and storage](../kernel/storage.md).
